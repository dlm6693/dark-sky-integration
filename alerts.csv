Snow will develop across the area during the mid-day hours, then diminish by early evening. The snow in central and east-central Wisconsin could transition to freezing drizzle as it tapers off late today and this evening. An inch or two of snow accumulation is expected across most of the area, with 2 to 3 inches possible in far north-central Wisconsin. The snow is likely to result in slippery travel conditions. Although the morning commute will not be affected, the afternoon commute is likely to be slowed by the snow. Be sure to allow for some extra travel time once the snow begins Much colder air will surge into the area overnight as the weather system producing the snow shifts off to the east. By daybreak Thursday, temperatures will drop to around zero across central and north-central Wisconsin, and into the teens along the Lakeshore. This will drive wind chill indices into the 10 below to 20 below zero range across most of the area, and to 5 below to 10 below along the Lakeshore. Wind chills such as this indicate exposed skin can suffer frostbite in as little as 30 minutes. Be sure to dress accordingly before heading out on Thursday morning. The gusty winds ushering the colder air into the area could also produce some drifting snow tonight, mainly in rural areas. Of greater significance is the potential for the rapid arrival of the colder air to cause any lingering water on the roads to re- freeze into glare ice and produce very slippery conditions. Be prepared for the possibility of icy spots on roads and sidewalks tomorrow morning.

Snow will develop across the area during the mid-day hours, then diminish by early evening. The snow in central and east-central Wisconsin could transition to freezing drizzle as it tapers off late today and this evening. An inch or two of snow accumulation is expected across most of the area, with 2 to 3 inches possible in far north-central Wisconsin. The snow is likely to result in slippery travel conditions. Although the morning commute will not be affected, the afternoon commute is likely to be slowed by the snow. Be sure to allow for some extra travel time once the snow begins Much colder air will surge into the area overnight as the weather system producing the snow shifts off to the east. By daybreak Thursday, temperatures will drop to around zero across central and north-central Wisconsin, and into the teens along the Lakeshore. This will drive wind chill indices into the 10 below to 20 below zero range across most of the area, and to 5 below to 10 below along the Lakeshore. Wind chills such as this indicate exposed skin can suffer frostbite in as little as 30 minutes. Be sure to dress accordingly before heading out on Thursday morning. The gusty winds ushering the colder air into the area could also produce some drifting snow tonight, mainly in rural areas. Of greater significance is the potential for the rapid arrival of the colder air to cause any lingering water on the roads to re- freeze into glare ice and produce very slippery conditions. Be prepared for the possibility of icy spots on roads and sidewalks tomorrow morning.

An inch or two of snow accumulation is expected across most of the area, with 2 to 3 inches possible in far north-central Wisconsin. The snow is likely to result in slippery travel conditions. Although the morning commute will not be affected, the afternoon commute is likely to be slowed by the snow. Be sure to allow for some extra travel time once the snow begins Much colder air will surge into the area overnight as the weather system producing the snow shifts off to the east. By daybreak Thursday, temperatures will drop to around zero across central and north-central Wisconsin, and into the teens along the Lakeshore. This will drive wind chill indices into the 10 below to 20 below zero range across most of the area, and to 5 below to 10 below along the Lakeshore. Wind chills such as this indicate exposed skin can suffer frostbite in as little as 30 minutes. Be sure to dress accordingly before heading out on Thursday morning. The gusty winds ushering the colder air into the area could also produce some drifting snow tonight, mainly in rural areas. Of greater significance is the potential for the rapid arrival of the colder air to cause any lingering water on the roads to re- freeze into glare ice and produce very slippery conditions. Be prepared for the possibility of icy spots on roads and sidewalks tomorrow morning.

Snow will develop across the area during the mid-day hours, then diminish by early evening. The snow in central and east-central Wisconsin could transition to freezing drizzle as it tapers off late today and this evening. An inch or two of snow accumulation is expected across most of the area, with 2 to 3 inches possible in far north-central Wisconsin. The snow is likely to result in slippery travel conditions. Although the morning commute will not be affected, the afternoon commute is likely to be slowed by the snow. Be sure to allow for some extra travel time once the snow begins Much colder air will surge into the area overnight as the weather system producing the snow shifts off to the east. By daybreak Thursday, temperatures will drop to around zero across central and north-central Wisconsin, and into the teens along the Lakeshore. This will drive wind chill indices into the 10 below to 20 below zero range across most of the area, and to 5 below to 10 below along the Lakeshore. Wind chills such as this indicate exposed skin can suffer frostbite in as little as 30 minutes. Be sure to dress accordingly before heading out on Thursday morning. The gusty winds ushering the colder air into the area could also produce some drifting snow tonight, mainly in rural areas. Of greater significance is the potential for the rapid arrival of the colder air to cause any lingering water on the roads to re- freeze into glare ice and produce very slippery conditions. Be prepared for the possibility of icy spots on roads and sidewalks tomorrow morning.

Snow will develop across the area during the mid-day hours, then diminish by early evening. The snow in central and east-central Wisconsin could transition to freezing drizzle as it tapers off late today and this evening. An inch or two of snow accumulation is expected across most of the area, with 2 to 3 inches possible in far north-central Wisconsin. The snow is likely to result in slippery travel conditions. Although the morning commute will not be affected, the afternoon commute is likely to be slowed by the snow. Be sure to allow for some extra travel time once the snow begins Much colder air will surge into the area overnight as the weather system producing the snow shifts off to the east. By daybreak Thursday, temperatures will drop to around zero across central and north-central Wisconsin, and into the teens along the Lakeshore. This will drive wind chill indices into the 10 below to 20 below zero range across most of the area, and to 5 below to 10 below along the Lakeshore. Wind chills such as this indicate exposed skin can suffer frostbite in as little as 30 minutes. Be sure to dress accordingly before heading out on Thursday morning. The gusty winds ushering the colder air into the area could also produce some drifting snow tonight, mainly in rural areas. Of greater significance is the potential for the rapid arrival of the colder air to cause any lingering water on the roads to re- freeze into glare ice and produce very slippery conditions. Be prepared for the possibility of icy spots on roads and sidewalks tomorrow morning.
